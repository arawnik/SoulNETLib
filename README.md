# JelaCoreLib

Repository for personal work towards development of implementations to help working with .NET Core. 

### Important Notices
Please note that alot of the content on this repository is still in progress. If you feel like there are some components that might make your life easier but you just cant get started with using them, please contact me and I'll improve my comments or add some helper page.

* This project attempts to work well even for big scale projects. Each of the developments are built for that purpose and checked that the result could work even at a bigger scale.
   * Keep in mind however that the testing is very limited due to lack of resources.
* It most likely isn't all ready for you, but a base for you to build on to get up and running very quickly with a solution that could scale.
* If you use these codes and you find bugs or improvements, feel free to share.

## Getting Started

You can get started with using this library by simply cloning this repository and adding this library into your project. I try to keep the versioning with the latest version of .NET Core but as this is a repository with personal work there is a chance you will need to do some minor tweaks to the code on version updates to get it up and running right away.

## Running the tests

Tests will be added at a later state.
