# SoulNETLib

Repository for (personal) work towards development of implementations to help working with open source .NET

Initial steps include basic quality of life improvements into a library and build them up into general and efficient form instead of solving the same issues in all projects.

### Important Notices
Please note that alot of the content on this repository is still in progress. If you feel like there are some components that might make your life easier but you just cant get started with using them, please contact me and I'll improve my comments or add some helper page.

* This project attempts to work well even for big scale projects. Each of the developments are built for that purpose and checked that the result could work even at a bigger scale.
   * Keep in mind however that the testing is very limited due to lack of resources.
* It most likely isn't all ready for you, but a base for you to build on to get up and running very quickly with a solution that could scale.
* If you use these codes and you find bugs or improvements, feel free to share.

## Getting Started

You can get started with using this library by simply installing the SDK, cloning this repository, restore NuGet packages and build the project. No special steps required.


I try to keep the versioning with the latest version of open source .NET but as this is a repository with personal work there is a chance you will need to do some minor tweaks.

## Running the tests

Tests are xUnit.net tests. Way to run them depends on your IDE. If you can build the project, you should be able to run the tests as well.
